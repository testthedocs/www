====================
Roundup February 2019
====================

Here our roundup for February 2019!

February was a busy month in terms of traveling and other daily life activities.

Still we managed to do some little things :)

FOSDEM
======

We were at `FOSDEM <https://fosdem.org/2019/>`_!

Since we were there, we even gave a `short talk <https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/testautomated/>`_ about "Different aspects of Continuous Integration for documentation testing".

General
=======

- We started to add slowly more and more CI integration and configurations to **all** our repositories.
- Started up update images to the latest versions of Alpine.
- Continued building the *CI Demo* setup.
- Continued with building our *overwatch* setup.
- Started with planning the rewrite of `Marvin <https://github.com/testthedocs/marvin>`_, more on that soon!
- Helped the `Plone community <https://plone.org>`_ with a (so far) basic implementation of quality assurance (style guide) checks.
